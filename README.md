# Final-project
Final project for Web Design 1

Hello!

Tiffany Churchill here, I would like to say a few things about myself. My hobbies include reading, swimming, photography, and etc. Some of my favorite foods include sushi, food from Panda Express, and rice in general. I think that what I really want to get out of this class is to improve myself in regards to designing websites and art in general.
